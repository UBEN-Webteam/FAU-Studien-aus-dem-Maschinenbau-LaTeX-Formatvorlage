% The above meta-comments are evaluated by some TeX editors like 
% TeXstudio and TeXmaker. They assure, that your editor always calls

% For debugging you can get a list of all used packages at the end
% of the log file by calling \listfiles
%\listfiles

% Loading the document class.
% For the bibliography and the list(s) of acronyms you can use standard
% package biblatex and acronyms resp. or use your own files. 
% The template uses a .bib file with a biblatex style and longtable
% environments for different lists of acronyms, symbols and formulas.
% If you would like to add a separate file for the bibliography or use
% package acronym, please consult the documentation of the general FAU
% template for setting the correct options.
